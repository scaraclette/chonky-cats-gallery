## To start application locally
```
$ npm install
$ npm run client-install
$ npm run dev
```

## Project Background
This web-app was created as a Node/React project. I wanted to create something simple and fun where others can try (unfortunately, only for cat owners though). Challenges I encountered when I created this project includes the deployement process for a seperate server-client app and being unfamiliar with React.
