## To start application locally
Create a .env by refering to the .env_sample in both parent folder and client.

$ npm run client-install

## Project Background
This web-app was created as a Node/React project. I wanted to create something simple and fun where others can try (unfortunately, only for cat owners though). Challenges I encountered when I created this project includes the deployement process for a seperate server-client app and being unfamiliar with React.
